<p>This option is for use when you wish to allow access to certain
services running on the firewall system to the Internet.  This option
should be used with care and any exposed service needs to be kept
patched and configured properly.  When this option is selected, a list
of services will be displayed the next time the Generate Firewall!
button is clicked.  If it is selected, at least one service must be
selected for the firewall to successfully generate.</p>
