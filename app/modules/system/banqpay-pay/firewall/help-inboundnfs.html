<h2 align="center">Help - Allow NFS Server</h2>

<p>Allowing connections to an NFS server through a firewall requires
a number of services that typically use random ports be configured
to use specific ports. The generator will prompt for those port numbers.
This help provides a quick look at each service. For more information,
read this site by Chris Lowth:
<a href="http://www.lowth.com/LinWiz/nfs_help.html" target="_blank">
http://www.lowth.com/LinWiz/nfs_help.html</a>. EFG uses a different suggested
port range purely because I thought I had already used 4000 as a suggestion
for something else.</p>

<h3>statd</h3>

<p>The rpc.statd program must be configured to start with the correct
port. Find the startup script that starts that daemon and add the -p
option. On a redhat system, that would be the /etc/init.d/nfslock
program. Change the startup line to: 'daemon rpc.statd -p 9400' (or
whatever port you select).</p>

<h3>lockd</h3>

<p>The NFS lock manager is a kernel module. If your system loads it
as a loadable module, add this line to /etc/modules.conf:
'options lockd nlm_udpport=9401 nlm_tcpport=9401'. Otherwise, the change
has to be made as a kernel option to the system boot loader. See the
above web site for more information.</p>

<h3>mountd</h3>

<p>The rpc.mountd program must be configured to use the specified port
with the '-p' option. On a redhat system, that can be done in the
/etc/sysconfig/nfs file with the line: MOUNTD_PORT=9402</p>

<h3>rquotad</h3>

<p>Specifying a port for rquotad requires at least version 3.08 of the
quota package. In order to implement the configuration, make sure the
following line is in the /etc/rpc file (exactly as given):</p>

<p>rquotad 100011 rquotaprog quota rquota</p>

<p>Then add two lines to /etc/services:

<ul>
<li>rquotad 9403/tcp</li>
<li>rquotad 9403/udp</li>
</ul></p>
