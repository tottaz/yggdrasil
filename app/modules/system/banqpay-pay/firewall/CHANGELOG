Version 1.17

05/11/2005 - tsm: Added rule to do ingress filtering as suggested
                  by Brian Buchanan

05/11/2005 - tsm: Changed the rule to drop broadcasts that would
                  otherwise be dropped to a better rule als
                  suggested by Brian Buchanan

Version 1.16

04/27/2005 - tsm: Added rules in bad_tcp_packets to filter packets
                  with illegal tcp flag combinations. This will
                  block many stealth scans.

04/27/2005 - tsm: Added the option to support inbound mDNSResponder.

Version 1.15

03/14/2004 - tsm: Added an option to configure inbound NFS.
                  Used this web site and included a pointer
                  in the help: http://www.lowth.com/LinWiz/nfs_help.html

03/14/2004 - tsm: Cleaned up the resources page.

03/14/2004 - tsm: Added a link to the CHANGELOG on the generator form.

03/14/2004 - tsm: Because of the worms blasting the 'net with pings,
                  changed the icmp chain to drop echo requests
                  without logging by default. (Earlier versions
                  dropped them and logged them by default.)

03/14/2004 - tsm: Added EFG version number to generated firewall script.

03/14/2004 - tsm: Updated the Interfaces help to make sure people
                  generating scripts for a single system know they
                  can just specify '+' to match every interface.

Version 1.14

05/24/2003 - tsm: Added an option to port forwarding to add rules to
                  redirect requests from internal systems to the
                  external IP of the firewall on the forwarded
                  port(s) to the internal system. Only works if
                  the firewall has a static and not a dynamic
                  IP address.  Of course, they really need
                  a static IP if using port forwarding anyway.

05/24/2003 - tsm: Added the tcp_syncookies kernel parameter setting
                  to ensure SYN flood protection is enabled.
                  Suggested by Salim Badakhchani (and several
                  others.)

05/24/2003 - tsm: Added the date the version was released under the
                  version number.  This was a request.

05/24/2003 - tsm: Added help for the inbound DNS server option that
                  explains the udp rules and the optional tcp_inbound
                  rule.

05/24/2003 - tsm: Pulled the separate little changelogs out of the files
                  and into this application CHANGELOG

04/10/2003 - Jan Pavlik: Added SSL option to the inbound Web Server
                         and Email options. 

Version 1.13

03/11/2003 - tsm: Added an option to allow a user-specified inbound
                  port range.

03/11/2003 - tsm: Added an option to allow MSN Messenger file
                  transfers.  Expanded the port forwarding
                  documentation as well. Suggested and researched
                  by Nuno Justo.

02/28/2003 - tsm: Fixed bug in log rule for forward chain introduced
                  version 1.11.

Version 1.12

02/25/2003 - tsm: Added an option to reject (rather than drop) ident
                  requests if the person uses irc.  Also included
                  some further tips for more sophisticated
                  configurations. Suggested by Dan Barron.

02/25/2003 - tsm: Tweaked installation instruction comments in generated
                  firewall script.

01/30/2003 - tsm: Added a rule in icmp_packets to drop initial ICMP
                  fragments.  Suggested by Alex Weeks.

Version 1.11

01/30/2003 - tsm: Added option to set up log for use with Fireparse

01/30/2003 - tsm: Added kernel setting options suggested by Alex Weeks
                  with additional explanation. (Thanks!)

Version 1.10

01/23/2003 - tsm: Ensure each script section specifies php

01/21/2003 - tsm: Commented out ip_dynaddr kernel settings in all
                  circumstances.  Caused problems in RH 8.0. Not
                  sure why yet.

Version 1.09

12/06/2002 - tsm: Modified port forwarding to allow either TCP/UDP or
                  both and an optional internal destination port.

12/06/2002 - tsm: Changed the port forwarding layout in the form

12/06/2002 - tsm: Altered tab index ranges by section to make easier
                  to change the form in the future.

12/05/2002 - tsm: Modified to block all subnet multicasts on the
                  internet interface.

Version 1.08

11/30/2002 - tsm: Fixed a bug in FORWARD chain so bad_packets will be dropped.

11/30/2002 - tsm: Allowed port forwarding to an internal system

11/30/2002 - tsm: Add ICQ advanced inbound options

11/30/2002 - tsm: Changed to allow ports to be specified for passive
                  ftp on inbound connections

Version 1.07

10/16/2002 - tsm: Made transparent proxy comment out HTTPS option by
                  default

10/16/2002 - tsm: Changed to use $_POST

Version 1.06

06/27/2002 - tsm: Added rule options for the multicast
                  packets seen from cable modems.
                  Fixed the TTL rule.

Version 1.05

05/23/2002 - tsm: Added credit section for Oskar Andreasson's
                 iptables-tutorials

05/22/2002 - tsm: Modified default behavior of bad_tcp_packets chain
                  so packets originating from the internal interface
                  (if one exists) are not processed through the
                  chain.  Provided expanded comments and alternative
                  rules.
                  Ensured all lines in the resulting file are 80
                  columns or less.

05/21/2002 - tsm: Fixed bug that added postrouting rule for single
                  system as well as gateway.
                  Drop INPUT broadcasts immediately before logging.

Version 1.04

05/20/2002 - tsm: Added logic to display Internal DHCP and External
                  DHCP options in the form

05/20/2002 - tsm: Updated to check for internal dhcp and external
                  dhcp options.

05/20/2002 - tsm: Fixed bug that failed to properly record static IP address.
                  Added code to allow system to act a dhcp server.
                  The autoconfig kludge is now more elegantly solved by
                  an Internal DHCP setting that specifically allows
                  DHCP packets from clients through the internal interface.
                  Some of the explicit returns from chains were missing.
                  Set internal output to internal interface to IP or IFACE.
                  Corrected bug that printed literal value, not variable
                  name.

Version 1.03

05/20/2002 - tsm: Added sysctl option to change kernel parameters.

                  netbios rules.

                  chkconfig implementation

05/17/2002 - tsm: Expand further on comments
                  Fixed FTP Client inbound port rule
                  Fixed OUTPUT chain rule for local_ip, only if there is one
                  Explicitly drop inbound netbios (137,138)
                  requests in udp_inbound without logging.  Cuts down
                  on noise in the logs if in an area with lots of windows
                  machines.  Only affects internet interface.
                  Explicitly accept LO_IFACE on OUTPUT chain

05/16/2002 - tsm: Added detail to the kernel module and proc setting sections
                  Added actions for arguments save and restore
                  Added generic bad_packets chain - call it first everywhere
                  except in OUTPUT chain. May add later.
                  Added invalid ICMP packets to OUTPUT
                  chain to remedy potential exploit.
