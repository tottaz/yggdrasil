<h2 align="center">Help - Network Notation</h2>

<p>One notation for describing a network range lists an address on the
network followed by a forward slash and the number of bits in the
address that describe the network.  For a Class A network, the network
designation would look like <strong>10.0.0.0/8</strong>.  For a Class B
network, the network designation would look like
<strong>172.20.0.0/16</strong>.  And for a Class C, it would like
<strong>192.168.50.0/24</strong>.</p>

<p>As a side note, in situations where network notation is required and
a single address is not allowed, the notation can still be used to
specify a single address.  Use the notation
<strong>192.168.50.100/32</strong>.  This specifies that all 32 bits of
the address form the <i>network</i>.  This is not relevant to the
firewall generated by this program, but is a useful tidbit of
information.</p>
