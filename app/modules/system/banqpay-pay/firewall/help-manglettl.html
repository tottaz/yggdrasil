<h2 align="center">Help - Mangle Packet TTL</h2>

<p>This advanced option will set the <i>Time to Live</i> or TTL
embedded in every IP packet.  The TTL is used to tell when a packet has
traveled too far without reaching its destination.  This prevents it
from traveling in infinite loops.  Normally this value is set by the
operating system and should not be changed.  However, some providers,
particularly broadband providers, do not want networks connected to the
Internet through a single gateway/firewall system.  Packets with varying
TTLs apparently coming from a single system are evidence of a private
network.  This option will allow you to set one TTL on all outbound
packets.</p>

<p>If this option is selected, the TTL field will appear the next time
the Generate Firewall! button is clicked.  If the Mangle TTL option is
checked, a value must be entered in the TTL field for the firewall to
successfully generate.  The default value is 128 hops.  I suggest that
you not change the default unless you <i>really</i> know what you're
doing.  A bad choice could have serious consequences.</p>

<p>Note: Broadband providers are beginning to look at traffic as the
sole measure and charge heavy users more whether they use a single
system or service a network.  This is a more reasonable approach than
attempting to prohibit networks attached through a gateway.  If your
provider does not restrict subscribers from using private networks, you
probably have no need to use this option.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The TTL target may not be included in the
distribution on your system.  If it is not and you require it, you will
have to add it.  That may require that you build from source.
