<h2 align="center">Help - Port Forwarding</h2>

<p>Port forwarding forwards all traffic on a specific port (or range of ports) from
the firewall to a computer on the internal LAN.  This can
be required to support special situations.  For instance,
this is the only way to support file transfers with an ICQ
client on an internal computer.  It's also required if an internal
system hosts a service such as a web server.  However, it's also
a dangerous option.  It allows Internet computers access to
your internal network.  Use it carefully and only if you're
certain you know what you're doing.</p>

<p>Easy Firewall Generator supports the creation of a single port
forwarding rule (or two if both tcp and udp are selected). If you
require additional rules, use the generated rules as a template to build
the additional rules in the output script. Be sure to create the
appropriate rule both in the PREROUTING chain of the NAT table and the
FORWARD chain of the INPUT table.</p>

<p>The following lists may help you determine which ports to forward.
