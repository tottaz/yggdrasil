<h2 align="center">Interfaces</h2>

<p>The interfaces are the network devices that connect to the Internet
or a local network.  Typically, the first ethernet card, <i>eth0</i>,
is connected to the Internet.  However, with a dial-up connection, the
<i>ppp</i> interface might be used instead.</p>

<p>If your firewall runs on a gateway for an internal network, the
internal interface is typically connected to the second ethernet card,
<i>eth1</i>.</p>

<p>Finally, the '+' symbol may be used instead of the interface number to
refer to all instances of that interface type.  For example, using
ppp+ instead of ppp0 or ppp1 will apply the rules to all the ppp
interfaces. If you are generating a script for a single system that
sometimes uses a dail-up connection and other times uses a network
connection, just specify + for the interface to match every
interface.</p>
