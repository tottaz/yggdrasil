<p>If your linux computer is also your orkstation and is not connected
to another network while you are connected to the Internet, select the
<i>Single System</i> option.</p>

<p>If your linux computer connects a network of computers to the
Internet, it is a <i>gateway</i> system. Further, if your internal
systems cannot directly connect to the Internet and do not allow
external systems to connect to them, they form a private internal
network. RFC 1918, Address Allocation for Private Internets, specifies
certain address ranges for use on private networks. This is the
configuration the firewall generator is designed to support when you
select the <i>Gateway/Firewall</i> option.</p>

<p>For most home and small office networks, a network in the Class C
private address range is adequate. This includes network addresses from
192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255.  By convention, the gateway system is
normally given the first usable address on the selected network.  Thus,
if you select 192.168.50.0 for your internal network, you would normally
assign the address 192.168.50.1 to the internal interface of the
gateway computer.</p>
