* nowrap (?change to be similar to labelWrap?)
* have button_grid use:
	- width/height for each button
	- cssStyle for each button
	- selection: open/closed
	- numCols: "*"
	- improve docs: explain css
* 


SPEC NOTES:
---------------------------
* per spec, "item.calculate" is an xpath expression that allows them to have a calculated value
	-- convert "getDisplayValue"
* per spec, readonly and required can be expressions, calculated dynamically at update time
* per spec, readonly is inherited (like relevant)!
* per spec, use "count()" to get number of items of a list
* "incremental:boolean" on items, seems to mean generate events more frequently
* help and hint on formItems
* "alert" on formItems, seems to be an error message
* there seems to be some concept of "reset" for instance data, although poorly specified
* actions -- interesting, eg: "setValue" to set a modelItem value
* there is a possibility that we'll have to run **all** validation code when anything changes,
	as well as "required" and "readonly" checks.  Make a script?


NOT PRIORITIZED
---------------------------
* be able to specify a ref that is data within the form itself, eg:
		$form/prop
	to store temporary values in the form.  Set on update, get on change?
	- use for composite widgets like Greg wants
	- use for add/remove fields for selection in the various boxes?
	- use for switches for the visible case?
	- nice if the form didn't know about this, and the model just handled it
* widget: add/remove boxes for selection
	-- check and see if there's a better paradigm
			-- select with checks?
	-- note that the "value" of the add/remove select is showing up as the "choices"
	-- note that we need to remove from one list to place in another...
* have a global, top-level "ref" for model so we don't have to do ref:"attr/X" for each modelItem
* choices:  use an object for value:label pairs
* dynamic choices
* item.getNotifyForm()  -- check is !, shouldn't be
* disabled property they can set?
* relevantIfEmpty ?
* forceUpdate for buttons to update name?
* forceUpdate forfor selects/etc to update list of options?
* image choices and selection:open/closed?
* forceUpdate: in onChange, used to mean ALL form items should be updated...
* notifyForm on composite items?


P1
---------------------------


* check in all code, examples and tests.  All work done from repository.
* safari?
* make item_test have at least one of each item type or variant for quick visual check

* model-level getter() w/same semantics as item level, but called on the model
	- property to set where callbacks are called -- on model, item, etc?

* internal property to ignore parentItem ref on init() (if set in parent)

* validators and constraints
	* repeat not showing [+]
	* all model routines should take either a path (string) or a modelItem?
	* model.getLeafValue(), etc should be on modelItem so we can return with proper type?
		-- really, each step of path should use the appropriate modelItem so it can
			call its getter ???   speed???
	* specify when errors show up (on leave field, on 'save'?)
	* error messages show up in-line in form or as alert?
	* 'registerTypeValidator'?  for other classes to provide type validation (and subsequent method?) to the modelItem
	* change form to handle:
		* string maxLength
		* visual indicator in forms for required fields
		* readonly fields in form -- convert to output?  mode in formItem?  disable in formItem?
		* where to show errors
			? insert at beginning of container HTML
			? insert/remove onChange of field ?
	? think about:
		? should getter/setter be called on model or modelItem?
		? "multi-type" value (list of value types tried in order)
		? "date" type (w/o time)?	-- how do we communicate this with the server?
		? "time" type?	-- how do we communicate this with the server
		? "enum" type (w/choices & selection:open|closed)
		? constraints where only one needs to be true (eg: value can be X or Y or Z)
		? do we need accessors?  xform doesn't use them.  Just remove?
	* doc
		* "untyped" item type
	* test:
		* type checking (in item_test.html)
		* enum model type  w/auto constraint (selection:open/closed)
		* keep model types consistent (eg: SELECTs sometimes turn string lists into arrays...
		* reasonable error messages!
		* i18n of error mesages
	

* field widths for appointment form - colspan:"*" ?
* testenv: make FormItem output more reasonable, esp for Dates, etc
* testenv: output ModelItems
* make selects and button grid work with any data type, not just strings
	-- talk to Dan about n squared time?

* borders
	* apply style to group/case/etc
	* css borders (can do now)
	* image borders
	* border/label combo
	
* sizing:
	* colSizes
	* outputAsTable(?) property to output set of items in a single table
		- TR as container?
	* dynamic vertical sizing (new msg form)
	* property to make containers scroll

* cache all properties that are used in update
	- ref, items, value, updateElement, etc
* alignment of formItems in container
* update docs


P2
---------------------------
* form.get(path) doesn't use modelItems initialized in formItems already
	-- give form a (ref)path index of items and get the item, then do item.getInstanceValue()?
* two-dimensional REPEAT type (for contacts card grid)
* test dynamic update rather than writing a script
* make a really big form to test for speed
* speed of repeats types? make repeat rows faster?
* don't init sub-items if they're not being drawn due to relevance?
* key handling
	- tabbing (incl. tabbing to button grid/dwt/etc)
	- only allow certain characters in fields
	- typing with pattern matching for number, date, etc?
* inheritance of attributes? a problem?
	- eg: value not being inherited?
* make good, well-named, consistent css classes
* ability to change options of a select on the fly (property of SELECT, run routine on update)
* repeat w/max number of rows (and scrolling?)
* test deep nesting of subclasses
	(wierdness with _BUTTON_GRID_ -> _TAB_BAR_ -> _SWITCH_TAB_BAR_)
* remove dependence on XFG class
* 
* model.addRowAfter:
	* only work if modelItem is a list?
	* have modelItem.getInstance() -- returns default instance
	* handle non-list type

P3
---------------------------
* disable for widget types (button grid, etc) -- just hide for now
* have logic to only enable/disable when state changes
* item.getElementValue() ???	(rename updateElement to setElementValue ?)
* numCols of "*" to mean however many items there are
* mechanism to set form-level defaults for various item types
* check speed of model routines, esp. parsing paths too often
* disable checkbox label
	(change checkbox to composite of CHECK and ANCHOR ?)
* form-level forceUpdate ?
* make _SWITCH_ automatically show nested _CASE_s if no relevant provided (property?)
* radio group class
* make labels clickable for checkbox/radio
* firefox draws old form images for just a second before applying update
	-- create items display:none by default?
* _OBJECT_ type for modelItems?
* checkbox doesn't use value property...
* consolidate XModelItemFactory and XFormItemFactory into a pattern/superclass?




POSSIBLE NEW FORMITEM TYPES
---------------------------
* more efficient _SELECT_ and _SELECT1_
	- ability to stick any type of item (or composite) in there
* _COMBO_BOX_ (_TEXTFIELD_ with choices)
* _SELECT_ that uses checkboxes to select
* _SELECT_ that allows you to re-order contents
* _SELECT_ w/ open selection w/ field that allow you to enter new value
* _SELECT_ w/ open selection where you can remove values from the list
* _TAG_
* _IMAGE_BUTTON_
* _TOOLBAR_
* _SPRING_SPACER_ (ala Mac toolbars, for spacing in toolbars)
* _CUSTOM_ which renders arbitrary HTML (or just create subclass?)
* _RANGE_ for slider
* autoComplete mechanism



THINGS TO THINK ABOUT OR TEST
-----------------------------
* consolidate XFormItemFactory into XForm?
* images with no SRC -- hide?
* are we using closures safely?
* event semantics: auto-add/remove listeners?
* have a _FORM_ type that we put at the outside of all the items?  do we need sub-forms?
* ability to show a sub-form in a dialog like apple does?
* make all output functions take an itemID so they can be string substituted in repeat?
	(doesn't help w/update...)




CODING STYLE POINTS
-----------------------------
* recommend specifying getter/setter/etc as function rather than string
* any time you're putting more than 2 lines of code in insert/update/etc
	-- make a function on XForm/XModel and call that instead
* all inserted handlers (esp onchange) should assume they're surrounded by "",
	ie: if referencing a string in a handler, us '', 
	eg: onchange="var value=X; someObject.set('foo',value)"
	



XFORM SPEC NOTES
-----------------------------
* 'calculate' property -- getter?
* match notions of "constraint"
* match notions of "relevant"
* bind concept for extending base item defaults in your form or model?
