<h1>XForms Package</h1>

<h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

The purpose of the XForms package is to provide an optimized mechanism for producing complex display and data-entry forms on the client, while shielding the developer from writing the HTML required to create these displays.  This implementation is both a subset of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xforms/" target=_blank>W3C XForms Specification</a>, in that not every piece of the spec is implemented, and an extension of the spec in that it provides a large number of additional attributes that allows the developer great flexibility over the appearance and behavior of the forms as they appear on screen.  Note that XForms are just as useful for providing a standardized way to present complex data as they are for creating complex input forms.

<p>
At the heart of every XForm are three pieces:
<LI>an <a href="#XForm_Object">XForm object</a>
<LI>an <a href="#XModel_Object">XModel object</a>
<LI>a <a href="#data_instance">data instance</a>
 
<p>
The <a name="XForm_Object">XForm object</a> specifies functionality and appearance of the form.  The meat of the XForm consists of a list of "items", each of which has some representation on the screen (see <a href="#XForm_Items">XForm Items</a>).  Many of the item types are visual (e.g. labels, text fields, checkboxes and buttons), while some are provided for grouping or aggregating sets of form items for display purposes.  A facility is provided for switching the set of fields displayed (much like a tabbed preference dialog or a wizard, where different sets of options are presented sequentially), and also for handling lists of items, where the XForm will automatically create as many rows in the display form as there are rows in the instance data.  XForm items are dynamically shown or hidden (see <a href="#relevant">relevant</a> property) as instance data changes, to hide controls that are not relevant due to the current state of the data instance.

<p>
The <a name="XModel_Object">XModel object</a> specifies the shape of the data -- how the data is organized hierarchically, data types and any constraints (validators) on the data.  The XModel is essentially a static set of items (referred to herein as "modelItems", to distinguish them from form "items"), and is used mainly to access and set property values in the current data instance, as well as to guarantee that data written to the instance is consistent with all constraints.  (see <a href="#XModel_Items">XModel Items</a>). An XForm can be instantiated without an XModel, in which case the XForm will create an "empty" XModel automatically.  It is common to have a number of XForms that point to a single XModel ("Singleton" pattern) -- for example, one might specify "simple display", "full display", "simple edit" and "full edit" forms that all point to the same piece of data, and thus share a single XModel.  

<p>
The <a name="data_instance">data instance</a> is either a simple Javascript object, or an instance of a Javascript class.  The ultimate purpose of the XForms mechanism is to display and modify this data.  By default, the XModel will access the properties of the instance directly according to XPath expressions embedded into the modelItem descriptions.  Within the XModel, a facility is provided to use functions to <a href=#xmodel_getter>get</a> or <a href=#xmodel_setter>set</a> various properties of the instance data to provide for calculated values, use multi-part widgets to control a single instance attribute, etc.  Also note that the XForm will save values into with the widget as the user interacts with the form -- when the user types a new value into a text field, that value will be saved in the instance when the user leaves the field.  If you want to provide the user with the facility to cancel editing actions on a form, you may want to clone the instance, and pass the clone into the form, then write any changed values back into the original instance when they hit "save."


<p class="sep"/>
<h2><a name="The_XForm_Object">The XForm Object</a></h2>

You will create a single XForm for every display, input form, etc that you want to create in your application.  You can either create a generic XForm and customize it by setting its items, etc. or you can subclass the XForm class itself and create instances of that.  Note that the XForm is an instance of the DwtComposite class -- in the standalone prototype mode (where DWT is not provided), a very basic DwtComposite is created -- (see <a href="#Standalone_Mode">Standalone Mode</a>).

<p>
The basic procedure to create and display an XForm goes like so:
<OL>
	<LI> Create the <a href="#XForm_Items">list of items</a> to be shown in the XForm.
	<LI> (optional) <a href="#new_XModel">Create an XModel</a> that describes the data instance.
	<LI> <a href="#new_XForm">Create the XForm</a>, passing in the list of items (in the attributes argument) and the XModel.
	<LI> Create the instance that the XForm will display and <a href="#setInstance">make the form aware of it</a>.  Note: you may want to clone the instance before handing it to the form; (see <a href="#Handling_Changes_to_the_Form">Handling Changes to the Form</a>).
	<LI> <a href="#draw">Draw the form</a> to display it.
	<LI> The user interacts with the form, <a href="#Getting_and_Setting_Instance_Values">values are automatically saved</a> in the instance.  The form is hidden when it is no longer used.
	<LI> At some point later, when the user wants to edit/display a new instance, simply <a href="#setInstance">point the form at the new instance</a> and show the form again.
</OL>

Note that the XForm is very smart about drawing -- it only creates the various widgets in the form once, then simply updates the values in these widgets dynamically as the instance data changes.

<p>
In the Model-View-Controller paradigm, an XForm can be thought of as a both a View -- in that it visually presents the instance data to the user -- and as a Controller -- in that it actually modifies the data.  It accomplishes this through managing (controlling) the set of XForm Items, which themselves present a view (of a small piece of the instance data) and a controller (the INPUT, SELECT, TEXTAREA, etc) that allows the user to change this datum.  This concept of nested views and controllers is very common in the MVC paradigm.  

<p>Because your form is probably a part of a larger system, say an entire DHTML application, the XForm understands that it in turn might be managerd by another controller.  When creating your form, you can <a href=#setController>set its controller</a>, then make references within the form and form items to this controller.  For instance, you might have a button in your xform that needs to show a dialog that is not part of the form.  The "onActivate" script of XFormItem that represents your button can be:

	<code class=call> onActivate:"this.getForm().getController().showSomeOtherDialog()"
	</code>

By setting up the reference from your form to the controller, you can avoid having to use static references to the controller within your form.  E.g., you want to avoid code like the following for the aforementioned <code>onActivate</code> trigger:
	<code class=call>onActivate:someGlobalController.getRef() + ".showSomeOtherDialog()"</code>
because it makes your code conceptually more confusing, and makes it harder to re-use this piece of code in other circumstances (where there might be a different controller).

<p class="sep"/>
<h2><a name="XForm_Attributes_of_Interest">XForm Attributes of Interest</a></h2>

<p>The following are properties of an XForm that you can add on instantiation to control how the form is rendered.  Pass these as the <code>attributes</code> of the form on instantiation, e.g.:
	<pre class=call>
	var myXForm = new XForm({
			id:"myForm",
			cssClass:"myFormClass",
			cssStyle:"border:1px solid blue;",
			items:[
				{type:_OUTPUT_, value:"Instructions for using this form..."},
				{ref:"name"},
				{ref:"phone"}
			],
			defaultItemType:_TEXTFIELD_,
			itemDefaults:{
				_OUTPUT_:     { cssClass:"myFormOutput" },
				_TEXTFIELD_:  { width:200  }
			
			}
		}, myXModel);</pre>


<table border=1>
<thead><tr>
	<td width=20%>Attribute (type)</td>
	<td width=80%>Description</td>
</tr></thead>

<tr><td><a name="xform.id"><code>id</code></a>
		<span class=datatype>(string)</span></td>
	<td>
Sets the DOM <code>id</code> of the HTML container that the XForm is drawn in, as well as the internal id of the xform in the Javascript context.  Because this is the DOM <code>id</code> of the form container, you can have an id'd CSS attribute in a CSS file that styles the container for the form, e.g., in a CSS file,
	<code class=call>#myForm	{	border:1px solid blue;	}</code>
will style the container for the above form.

<p>
Note that if you instantiate more than one form with the same <code>id</code>, the second and subsequent forms will have a number appended to their name to make them unique, eg:  <code>myForm</code>, <code>myForm2</code>, <code>myForm3</code>, etc.   
<p>
To get a pointer to an XForm with a particular <code>id</code>, use:
	<code class=call>XFG.cacheGet(<i>id</i>)</code>
<p>If you do not provide an <code>id</code>, forms wll default to <code>id</code>s of <code>_XForm</code>, <code>_XForm2</code>, etc.

XFormItem type which will be used to instantiate the form's <code>items</code>, when an item does not specify an explicit <code>type</code>.  In the above example, both <code>name</code> and <code>phone</code> would be created as <code>_TEXTFIELD_</code> items.
<p>Default is <code>_OUTPUT_</code>.
</td>
</tr>


<tr><td><a name="xform.itemDefaults"><code>itemDefaults</code></a>
		<span class=datatype>(object)</span></td>
	<td>
<p>Use this to customize different XFormItem types for this form.  The syntax is an object with <code>typename:propertylist</code> pairs.  For this form only, the defaults that you provide for each type name will override the normal default properties for that type.  E.g., in our example above, all <code>_OUTPUT_</code> formItems will have a cssClass of "myFormOutput" and all <code>_TEXTFIELD_</code> items will be 200 pixels wide.  You can override any properties of the formItems you want, including methods.
<p>
Note that a current limitation of this implementation is that the defaults will only apply to the particular formItem type you specify in the itemDefaults, not to subclsses of that formItem type.  E.g. setting a default for the <code>_TEXTFIELD_</code> formitem type will not apply to the <code>_PASSWORD_</code> formitem type, even though the <code>_PASSWORD_</code> implementation derives from <code>_TEXTFIELD_</code>.
<p>Default is <code>null</code> (no customization).

<p class="sep"/>
<h2><a name="XForm_Items">XForm Items</a></h2>
XForm items are the things that are actually displayed in the the form.  Each widget is automatically converted to be an instance of a XFormItem subclass when the form is initialized.  

<p>XForm items fall into five basic categories:
	<ul>
		<li><a href="#widget_item_types">Widgets</a> (input, output, select, etc)
		<li><a href="#composite_item_types">Composite Items</a> (date, etc)
		<li><a href="#grouping_item_types">Grouping Items</a> (group, switch, case)
		<li><a href="#repeating_item_types">Repeating structures</a> (repeat)
		<li><a href="#appearance_item_types">Form appearance</a> items (spacer, separator)
	</ul>
<p>
At a minimum, each form item has a <code>type</code> attribute which controls how it is displayed (as a text field, selection box, text label, etc).  In addition to the <a href=#W3C_Compliance>standard XForm types</a>, this implementation includes a large number of additional item types, allowing you to create very complex forms.  If the type of a form item is not specified, it is assumed to be of the <code>output</code> type.
<p>
<a name=group_item_ref> </a>Many form items also specify a <code>ref</code> attribute, which links this form item to a modelItem, specified in the XModel for the form.  Form items with <code>ref</code>s will automatically display the value contained in the current instance when the form is updated.  Note that grouping items can also specify a <code>ref</code> attribute; any sub-items of the group with a <code>ref</code> will be nested under the ref of the group.  e.g.:
	<pre>
		{type:_GROUP_, ref:"address", items:[
				{type:_INPUT_, ref:"street"},
				{type:_INPUT_, ref:"city"},
				{type:_INPUT_, ref:"state"},
				{type:_INPUT_, ref:"zip"},
			]
		}
	</pre>
Each of the input elements within the group will inherit the <code>address</code> reference from the group, so their references are effectively <code>"address/street"</code>, <code>"address/city"</code>, etc.  The XForm handles setting this up with the appropriate XModel modelItems automatically.



<p class="sep"/>
<h2><a name="item_types">XFormItem Types</a></h2>

Note that when specifying widgets in JavaScript you should use constants defined by the XFormItem classes to reference the different types of widgets.  E.g.

	<code class=call>{type:_OUTPUT_, ref:"foo"}</code>

will create an "output" type widget.  When specifying widgets in XML, use the lowercase widget names specified below, eg:
	<code class=call>&lt;output ref="foo" /&gt;</code>


<p>The item types detailed below are divided into the following categories:

<ul>
	<li><a href="#widget_item_types">Widget Item Types</a></li>
	<li><a href="#composite_item_types">Composite Item Types</a></li>
	<li><a href="#grouping_item_types">Grouping Item Types</a></li>

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;choices:{a,"AAAA", b:"BBB"}</code>

If an <code>_INPUT_</code> is hooked up to a modelItem through its <code>ref</code> property, the spec indicates that the type of the widget actually displayed to edit the value of the field will change based on properties of the modelItem or the formItem.  For example, if an <code>_INPUT_</code> is hooked up to a <code>_DATE_</code> modelItem, it should render as a date selection widget.  This XForms package implements this behavior.  

<p>The authors of this package recommend using the more explicit types detailed below (e.g. <code>_TEXTFIELD_</code>, <code>_CHECKBOX_</code>, etc) when possible as it is will be clearer to maintainers of your form exactly what is being specified.

Use this to group a set of formItems either logically or visually.  For example, if you have a number of formItems that you want to show or hide all together, place them in a <code>_GROUP_</code> and set the <code>relevant</code> property of the group rather than setting it on each item.
<p>
Alternatively, if you want to have more than one item appear in one logical cell in the <a href=#layout_considerations>form layout</a>, place those items in a <code>_GROUP_</code>.
<p>Within the <code>_GROUP_</code>, the <code>items</code> property is the set of items that the group will display.  The system will take care of initializing these objects for you.
<p>Note that if you're using a <code>_GROUP_</code> to put more than one item in a single "cell" in the outer form, you might want to specify a label on the <code>_GROUP_</code> itself rather than on the first item within the group.  This will make the label line up with the other labels in the form properly.
<p>See also this note about <a href=#group_item_ref>group items specifying a ref property for their sub-items</a>.

Use a <code>_SWITCH_</code> formItem to display one of a number of sets of formItems.  
<p>For example, think of a tabbed preferences dialog:  the <code>_SWITCH_</code> item is the one that controls which of the preference "panes" is visible.  Each of the panes themselves is implemented as a <code>_CASE_</code> formItem.  You can use a <code>_TAB_GROUP_</code> formItem to show each <code>_CASE_</code> as appropriate.
<p>Another example of where you might use a <code>_SWITCH_</code> is with a setup wizard interface -- you would again have a single <code>_SWITCH_</code> and multiple <code>_CASE_</code> formItems, but buttons at the bottom of each <code>_CASE_</code> would show the proper <code>_CASE_</code> elements in turn.
<p>
Currently the best way to use a <code>_SWITCH_</code> is to hook it up to some value in your data instance using the <code>ref</code> property, then have the items in the <code>_TAB_GROUP_</code> property set the appropriate value in that <code>ref</code> when they are clicked.  The <code>_CASE_</code> formItems are set as the <code>items</code> property of the <code>_SWITCH_</code>, and their <code>relevant</code> property is set to the value of the <code>ref</code>'d attribute.  e.g:

<pre class=call>
  {type:_TAB_GROUP_, ref:"myVar",
     choices:{
        a:"Home Address",
        b:"Work Address",

Set the <code>items</code> of the _REPEAT_ to a list of formItems to be duplicated for each row in the data instance.  You can place any formItems in there as you want.  The <code>numCols</code> of the repeat will set the number of columns displayed per line within the repeated items.  Set the <code>number</code> property of the repeat to the minimum number of repeat rows of you want visible at all times -- usually this is fine set to 1.
<p>
The <code>showAddButton</code> and <code>showRemoveButton</code> properties, when true, will show the formItems <code>addButton</code> and <code>removeButton</code> for each repeated row.  Note that the default behavior is that the <code>addButton</code> is only shown on the last row of the repeat.  You can have different <code>addButton</code>s and <code>removeButtons</code>s by simply specifying these properties in your repeat instance -- look at the implementation for how to code these buttons.

<h2><a name="XForm_Item_Attributes">XForm Item Attributes</a></h2>
The following is a list of the attributes that can be applied to an XForm item.  Just as HTML provides some default properties that apply to certain tags (e.g. anchors have underlines, headings show a larger font size, etc.), the XForm class provides defaults for each of the <a href="#XForm_Items">form item types</a> that you can define.  In this way, you get a reasonable default behavior without having to write properties on each widget.
<p>
It is often convenient to provide defaults for the behavior and appearance of form items in the modelItems that the form item links to.  For example, for a given instance attribute, the list of <code>choices</code> is likely to be the same whether the attribute is displayed as a select, output as a label, etc.  To some extent, the list of internal values and external labels for these values can be thought of as properties of the model -- by default, each form or field that displays these values should have the same set of <code>choices</code>, with a particular field, of course, being able to override these defaults.  So for most form item attributes, we'll look up values like so:

	<ol>
		<li>Look in the form item attributes provided by the author when the form was created.
		<li>Look in the prototype chain for the formItem type.
		<li>Look in the modelItem that corresponds to the field (if provided).
	</ol>
Thus the system can provide reasonable defaults, the model can provide defaults, but the form item itself can always override these defaults.  Note that there are a small number of properties that do not use this inheritance mechanism -- those wil be called out in the table below.
<p>
Note that you can use the <a href="#xform.itemDefaults">itemDefaults</a> property of your form to customize the defaults for one or more item types.
<p>
The following is the current list of form item attributes.  Items with an asterisk (*) after them are not specified in the W3C XForms spec or have different semantics than those specified in the spec.

This behavior is replicated in this implementation.  If for some reason you want to specify a text field that has a <code>value</code>, use the <code>textfield</code> item type instead.

	<p>this indicates that the item is only relevant if the value of the "repeat_type" property in the current instance being displayed is not "N".  If the value is "N", the item would be hidden or disabled (see <a href="#relevantBehavior"><code>relevantBehavior</code></a>).
	<p>Note that item relevance is nested -- if a group item is not relevant, we automatically assume that all children of that group are not relevant.
	
	<p>In the <code>relevant</code> expression, you can use the following variables and method calls:

		<span class=datatype>(boolean)</span></td>
	<td>By default, the systems only updates form items that have specified a <code>ref</code> in their attributes, linking them to a modelItem and thus to a value in the data instance being displayed.  Sometimes you want to override this behavior, to always force an item to update in the update cycle, whether it has a <code>ref</code> or not.  Set <code>forceUpdate:true</code> to accomplish this.
	<p>Note also that the system attempts to be smart during the update cycle, remembering the last display value actually placed in a formItems DOM element.  If the value on this update cycle is the same as the value updated last time, the actual DOM element will not be changed.  This can sometimes lead to problems with values such as Dates or Arrays where the contents of the value may change, but the object itself is the same.  If you're seeing a case where a field element in the form is not changing when you think it should, try setting <code>forceUpdate:true</code> on the formItem.
	<p>Note: it is always safe to use this property -- at worst, it might result in a very small speed penalty on update.  If you're finding a definable pattern where you're always having to set <code>forceUpdate:true</code>, bring it to the authors' attention and we can probably make the system smart enough to do this automatically.

For example, a <code>_DATE_</code> field might be a composite item, made of three <code>_SELECT1_</code> widgets.  For the "month" selector, you want to transform the value (a Date object) into the number of the month.  You would use <code>getDisplayValue()</code> for this.

	<td>Function that is called when the HTML widget that the user actually interacts with is manipulated, i.e., they type a new value into a _TEXTFIELD_ or select a different value from a _SELECT1_.  
<p>The exact call is:
	<code class=call>item.elementChanged(elementValue, instanceValue, event)</code>, where
	<li><code>elementValue</code> is the newly changed value
	<li><code>instanceValue</code> is the value previously stored in the data instance for this item, and
	<li><code>event</code> is the browser event.
<p>	
	The default implementation is to call
		<code class=call>this.getForm().itemChanged(this, elementValue, event)</code>
		which will validate the value and insert it back into the model, as appropriate.
<p>
You might want to override this, for example, in a composite item that is setting a single part of a complex value.  For example, lets say you have a _DATE_ field that is composed of three simple widgets.  Each of those widgets is setting a part of the date (the month, day, etc).  You want a change to any sub-item of the _DATE_ widget to represent a change the actual date, rather than exposing that they changed only a piece of the date.  To do this, you'll implement an <code>elementChanged</code> handler that will compose the changed bit with the current date, then call <code>itemChanged()</code> on the form with the new value.  e.g. for the "month" pulldown:
	<pre>
  elementChanged:function(elementValue, instanceValue, event) {
    // elementValue is the number of the new month that they selected
    // instanceValue is the original date stored for this value
    instanceValue.setMonth(elementValue);
    this.getForm().itemChanged(this.getParentItem(), instanceValue, event);
  }</pre>
Note we call <code>itemChanged()</code> on the parent item (the _DATE_ widget): this ensures that if there is a validation error, the error will be displayed above the entire _DATE_ widget, rather than just above the "month" pull-down.

<h2><a name="Drawing_and_Update_Semantics">Drawing and Update Semantics</a></h2>
<p>
When the system draws an XForm, it runs through the entire (nested) list of items, and does the following things:
	<ol>
		<li>initialize each item (hooking it up to its modelItem, figuring out nested references, etc),
		<li>write each item's HTML into the HTMLOutput stream,
		<li>marks any items that need to be inserted into the form after the form is drawn, and
		<li>adds code to the <a href=#updateScript>updateScript</a> for each item that needs it.
	</ol>

(Note that drawing can proceed without a data instance being attached to the form).
<p>
When it comes time to display an actual data instance (either because one was passed in initially before the form was drawn, or because some other code called <code>xform.setInstance(instance)</code> on a xform that has been drawn already, the system runs through the <a href=#update_script>updateScript</a> that was created when the form was initially drawn.
<p>
This <a name=updateScript>updateScript</a> is responsible for the following:
	<ol>
		<li>Determining if each item is <a href=#relevant>relevant</a> and <a href=#relevantBehavior>showing/hiding or disabling/enabling</a> the element as necessary.
		<li>If an item is relevant and it needs to be inserted into the form (e.g. is an externally populated widget), it will call the item's <a href=#insertMethod>insert method</a> to insert the item into the form.  This is done exactly once per item.
		<li>If the item is relevant and it has a reference or otherwise specifies that it should always be updated, the updateScript will call the item's <a href=#updateMethod>updateMethod</a> to show the current value in the data instance for that item.
	</ol>

<p>Note that the full update script is run every time any value in the form is changed.  This ensures that calculated values, multiple values that might be changed by manipulation of a single control, or any values that are duplicated within the form (perhaps once as a label and once as an input field), etc. always stay in synch with the current state of the data instance.  The updateScript has been tuned to run very quickly, even for complex forms.  One way this is accomplished is that form items that are not relevant (and are thus hidden) will not be updated.  

<p>By default, the form widgets themselves are encouraged to remember the last values displayed, and not actually manipulate the DOM unless the values have changed.  This is considerably faster, especially in Internet Explorer.  However, there may be times when all value needs to be forced to update when some value changes.  To accomplish this, set <a href=#forceUpdate><code>forceUpdate:true</code></a> on the particular item which needs to force the update.  Note this will not force the update of items which are not <a href=#relevant><code>relevant</code></a> and are hidden, and that forcing all items to update can be considerably slower, especially for complex forms.


<p>You can also manually run the updateScript at any time, for example, if the server or another process updates the value of the current data instance, by calling <a href=#refresh><code>xform.refresh()</code></a>.


<p class="sep"/>
<h2><a name="Handling_Changes_to_the_Form">Handling Changes to the Form</a></h2>
<p>When the user manipulates a form widget to make a change to the data, the xform calls the method <code>xform.itemChanged(itemId, value, event)</code>.  This routine:
	<ol>
		<li>Checks to see if the item has defined a <a href=#onChange><code>onChange</code></a> function, and if it has, it calls this routine.  Treats the value returned by the onChange handler as if the original form widget had returned that value.
		<li>If there was no <code>onChange</code> function, the routine will save the value in the instance by calling <code>model.set(fullItemXPath, newValue)</code>.  See <a href=#Getting_and_Setting_Instance_Values>Getting and Setting Instance Values</a> for how the model saves the value into the form.

<h2><a name="Creating_New_Widget_Types">Creating New Widget Types</a></h2>

<p>
The default set of controls provided with this XForms package is
sufficient for most tasks. However, the implementation allows new
types of controls to be added dynamically for those situations
where the provided controls are not appropriate or do not fulfil
the requirements. This section describes how to implement custom
controls for the following two cases:
</p>
<ul>
<li>a value in the data instance is complex and needs to be
handled using multiple controls; and</li>
<li>a custom user interface is needed to display a value.</li>
</ul>
<p>
A <code>_COMPOSITE_</code> control allows you to create a
new control that is an aggregate of other controls. This
allows you to take a single, complex value in the data instance
and have separate controls manage each part. You can also use 
a composite to handle parts of the data instance as a single 
re-usable form unit.
</p>
<p>
There are three steps to creating and using a composite
component:
</p>
<ol>
<li>register new type with the <code>XFormItemFactory</code>;</li>
<li>set the list of child components as the <code>items</code>
property of the new type's <code>prototype</code> object; and</li>
<li>use the new type in your form.
</ol>
<p>
The following example creates a composite control that displays
the red, green, and blue components of a color in the data
instance using separate input fields.
First, we register new type with the <code>XFormItemFactory</code>.
Adding some convenience methods on the object prototype helps us in
the next step when we define the form items.
</p>
<pre>
function ColorInput() { }
XFormItemFactory.createItemType("_COLOR_", "color", ColorInput, _COMPOSITE_);

// NOTE: setXXX(value) methods replace hex color component value in 
//       color strings that match "#RRGGBB"
ColorInput.prototype.setRed = function(value) {
    var ivalue = this.getInstanceValue();
    return '#' + value + ivalue.substr(3,4);
}
ColorInput.prototype.setGreen = function(value) {
    var ivalue = this.getInstanceValue();
    return '#' + ivalue.substr(1,2) + value + ivalue.substr(5,2);
}
ColorInput.prototype.setBlue = function(value) {
    var ivalue = this.getInstanceValue();
    return '#' + ivalue.substr(1,4) + value;
}
</pre>
<p>
Next, we set the list of child components as the items property. We
implement the <code>getDisplayValue</code> method on each child 
component to map the data value to the component value; and we
implement the <code>onChange</code> method in order to map changes
back to the data value.
</p>
<pre>
ColorInput.prototype.items = [
    // NOTE: This child component references the same data as the
    //       parent level using ref: "."
    { ref: ".", type: _INPUT_, label: "R", width: "3em",
        getDisplayValue: function(value) { return value.substr(1,2); },
        onChange: function(value, event, form) {
            // NOTE: the parent item is of type ColorInput
            return this.getParentItem().setRed(value);
        }
    },
    { ref: ".", type: _INPUT_, label: "G", width: "3em",
        getDisplayValue: function(value) { return value.substr(3,2); },
        onChange: function(value, event, form) {
            return this.getParentItem().setGreen(value);
        }
    },
    { ref: ".", type: _INPUT_, label: "B", width: "3em",
        getDisplayValue: function(value) { return value.substr(5,2); },
        onChange: function(value, event, form) {
            return this.getParentItem().setBlue(value);
        }
    }
];
</pre>
<p>
Finally, we can now use the new <code>_COLOR_</code> type in our form.
</p>
<pre>
var myform = {
    { ref: 'color', type: _COLOR_ }
};
</pre>
<p>
In addition to creating composite controls, you can also create
custom controls that are bound to data instance values. Continuing
our color example, we will create a color swatch that shows the
currently entered color as the background of the new control.
</p>
<p>
There are four steps to create a custom control:
</p>
<ol>
<li>define object;</li>
<li>add object methods for form rendering;</li>
<li>register new type and add factory method; and</li>
<li>use the new type in your form.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Because the new control is not based on an existing type, we first
need to create a new object type.
The constructor should take an attributes object (which can be used
to map DWT attributes to the new control).
</p>
<pre>
function ColorSwatch(attributes) {
    // copy any properties passed to the object
    for (var prop in attributes) {
        this[prop] = attributes[prop];
    }
}

ColorSwatch.prototype.value = 'white'; // default bgcolor
</pre>
<p>
Next, we define some object methods for use when the control 
is being used. The <code>resetStyle</code> method sets the
CSS of the displayed component &mdash; we call this method 
when the data value changes and the HTML needs to be updated.
</p>
<pre>
ColorSwatch.prototype.setValue = function(value) {
    this.value = value;
}

ColorSwatch.prototype.resetStyle = function(element) {
    element.style.backgroundColor = this.value;
    // NOTE: extra style info should be part of CSS class
    element.style.width = '30px';
    element.style.border = 'black solid 1px';
}
</pre>
<p>
Now that our object is defined, it must have two methods
defined for the XForms framework to render it:
<code>insertIntoXForm</code> and <code>updateInXForm</code>.
The former method is called when the control is first 
rendered and the latter is called when the bound data
value changes and the display needs to be updated.
</p>
<pre>
ColorSwatch.prototype.insertIntoXForm = function(form, item, element) {
    // NOTE: this method returns the control's HTML but
    //       we don't display anything but the bgcolor
    element.innerHTML = "&amp;nbsp;";
}

ColorSwatch.prototype.updateInXForm = function(form, item, value, element) {
    this.setValue(value);
    this.resetStyle(element);
}
</pre>
<p>
After that is done, the new type is registered with the
<code>XFormItemFactory</code> using <code>_WIDGET_ADAPTER_</code>
as the base type. To allow the widget adapter to construct
your new component object, though, the <code>constructWidget</code>
method must be implemented.
</p>
<pre>
function ColorSwatchWidget() { }
XFormItemFactory.createItemType("_COLOR_SWATCH_", "color_swatch", ColorSwatchWidget, _WIDGET_ADAPTOR_);

ColorSwatchWidget.prototype.constructWidget = function() {
    var attributes = {
        // place widget attributes here
    };
    return new ColorSwatch(attributes);
}
</pre>
<p>
Finally, the new control can be used in your form.
</p>
<pre>
var myform = {
    items: [
        { ref: "color", type: _COLOR_SWATCH_ }
    ]
};</pre>

<h2><a name="The_XModel_Object">The XModel Object</a></h2>
The XModel object itself is simple very simple, and tends to be static.  You will generally create one XModel for each data type you have (e.g. an "appointment" or "contact" object) and then use that in one or more forms.  Rather than creating instances of the model to apply to each form, you assign a single instance of the model to all forms that use it.  When the form wants the model to display a value, it will explicitly pass it the data instance that the model is to use.
